Simulate the finals exam of course 324973 - The Language of Music-syntax of Tones at Technion.


## BRIEF

I took this side-course as part of my degree and its final test was to be a "human Shazam" and identify pieces that were half an hour in duration, so I realized that it is necessary to build a suitable tool to help me to prepare for the test, and the entire class as well.

## Exam Rules

A 30 second part of a piece will be played 3 times.
You will have to guess the piece within 3 times or less.
